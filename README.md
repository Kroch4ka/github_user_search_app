## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Working with third party API
- Basic JavaScript Features

### Continued development

So far, I'm not very comfortable with GRID technology and the implementation of responsive design. There are also difficulties with the organization of the structure and the implementation of storing the state of the application. In this small application, I did not want to download third-party dependencies for state management like Redux or Mobx.
